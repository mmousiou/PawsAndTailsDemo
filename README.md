## Application Lifecycle
1. Idea and Planning
2. Requirement Analysis
3. Design
4. Development
5. Testing
6. Deployment - Release
7. Maintenance and Support

## Data Structure
### General guidlines
* Gather detailed requirements, including data entities, relationships, and attributes.
* Understand user needs and expectations.
* Create the Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) to visualize the data model. (it is usually on the design phase but it is easier to see the datamodel with it)

### Specific: Define schema and ERD
* how many objects should be added?
* which fields should these new objects have?
* for each of these new objects can you define the relationships?

## Development
### Challenge:
- Utilize Salesforce Lightning components for an intuitive appointment management interface
- Write code based on the design specifications.
- Develop both the frontend and backend components.

### Key Considerations:
- Lightning components for a user-friendly interface.
- Gather appointments from salesforce¬†database (Utilize AI for code)
- Write code based on the design¬†specifications.

### Code Sample
* Download the .zip file
* Add the contents of the classes and lwc folders to the respected folders of your org's \force-app\main\default directory

## Testing
The testing phase is crucial to ensure that the implemented Salesforce solution meets the requirements and functions smoothly.
### Challenge:
- Conduct thorough testing of the appointment management system
- Validate that the system performs as intended and is user-friendly.
- Address any issues or enhancements identified during testing.

### Key Considerations:
- Conduct unit testing, integration testing, and system testing.
