## Requirement Analysis and Data Structure
### General guidlines
* Gather detailed requirements, including data entities, relationships, and attributes.
* Understand user needs and expectations.
* Create the Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) to visualize the data model. (it is usually on the design phase but it is easier to see the datamodel with it)

### Specific: Define schema and ERD
* how many objects should be added?
* which fields should these new objects have?
* for each of these new objects can you define the relationships that must exist.


## Design
* Design the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX).
* Plan the architecture and technology stack
* Design flowcharts for complex algorithms, decision trees, or business logic

## Development
### General guidlines
* Write code based on the design specifications.
* Develop both the frontend and backend components.

### Code Sample
* Download the .zip file
* Add the contents of the classes and lwc folders to the respected folders of your org's \force-app\main\default directory
